# Hex Hover Converter
![](assets/hex-hover-converter.gif)

The "Hex Hover Converter" converts numbers into their decimal, hexadecimal and binary format.
You simply have to hover over the number with your mouse.
Conversion takes place in all directions. I.e. decimal is converted to hexadecimal and binary. Hexadecimal is converted to decimal and binary, etc.

# Customizations
You can customize the appearance of the hovers globally ("User") and per workspace.
For each type of conversion (decimal to hex/binary, hex to decimal/binary or binary to decimal/hex) you can define a different format string.
If you don't want a conversion to appear (e.g. if you don't want the line with the binary conversions) you simply clear the line.




# Hovers in Debug Mode
vscode turns the normal hovers off if in debug mode. To make them visible press the "ALT" key while hovering.

# License and Acknowledgements
This extension is based on the https://github.com/thegtproject/vscode-hoverhex by [Brandon/thegtproject](https://github.com/thegtproject) and originally was a pull request.
But the original project seems to be abandoned.
As it is MIT licensed I decided to use the extension skeleton from the original project and enhance the simple hex conversion into a more enhanced decimal-hex-binary conversion in all directions.

This extension here is also MIT licensed.
